# linux-project-2

In this project i created some folders and files in a directory, change directory, and navigated to create groups and users. I also assigned these groups and users to executory shells (/bin/bash) and a group_id (GID).

Finally, i wrote a shell script to AUTOMATE this same process. To make it more reuserble as well.
